# task-board

## Description

I am creating a task board so I can add the tasks I need to do and keep track of when I need to get them done by. It will also help me keep track of what's done, what I've started, and what I still have to start.

## Usage

You can access the website using https://ultimavanguard.github.io/task-board/ this link.

You can click add task to bring up a modal where you input task name, due date, and a description. If you don't enter a piece of the form, you will get an alert telling you to complete the form.

After you have filled the form it will be added to the task board in the to-do's list. If the due date is the current day the card will be yellow. If it's past due it will be read. Otherwise the card will be white.

You can move the cards around the board to be in-progress or done. Any of the cards in done will revert to being a white card.

Once you are done with a card, you can delete it with the delete button.

Whe you refresh the page, the board will be like you had it when you come back due to being stored in local storage.
